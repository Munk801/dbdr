# dbdr

A companion app to Dead By Daylight.  The code will not fully build as it requires a connection to Firebase.  If you would like to set up your own database, feel free to contact and I can describe the table structure for thd data.  You can also read the code to determine how the information should be pulled.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

```
git clone https://github.com/Munk801/dbdr.git
cd dbdr
touch FIREBASE_APIKEY.txt
paste your firebase api key in that text file
```

## Updating your keys for android

This app has been set up for release on android.  This requires you create a key file and reference this.  For more information, please refer to:
